# KelvinVR Library

## Overview

KelvinVR is a versatile library designed for Arduino and ESP32 platforms, providing functionality for [brief description of what the library does, e.g., "controlling VR-related hardware components"]. This library is compatible with various Arduino boards (including Uno and Mega) as well as ESP32, making it flexible for different project requirements.

## Features

- Cross-platform support (Arduino and ESP32)
- [List key features of the library]
- Easy-to-use API for [main functionalities]
- [Any other notable features]

## Installation

1. Download the KelvinVR library (either clone this repository or download as ZIP)
2. In the Arduino IDE, go to Sketch > Include Library > Add .ZIP Library
3. Select the downloaded KelvinVR folder or ZIP file
4. The library is now installed and ready to use

## Usage

To use the KelvinVR library in your sketch:

1. Include the library header:
   ```cpp
   #include <KelvinVR.h>
   ```

## Create an instance of the KelvinVR class:
```cpp
KelvinVR kelvinVR;
```



## Initialize the library in your setup() function:
```cpp
void setup() {
  kelvinVR.begin();
}
```

## Use the library functions in your loop() or other functions:
```cpp
void loop() {
  kelvinVR.update();
  // Other code using KelvinVR functions
}
```

## Examples
The library comes with several example sketches demonstrating its usage:

BasicExample: Demonstrates basic functionality of the library

LEDTest: Shows how to control LEDs using the library

List other examples

To access the examples, go to File > Examples > KelvinVR in the Arduino IDE.
